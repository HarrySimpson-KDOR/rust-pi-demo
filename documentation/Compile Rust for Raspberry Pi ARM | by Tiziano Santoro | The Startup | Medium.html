In this article we will build a simple HTTP server application in Rust,
cross-compile it for the Raspberry Pi ARM architecture, deploy it to a
Raspberry Pi board over a network connection, and install it as a
persistent service so that it restarts automatically at boot time and
upon crash.


  Background

For the rest of the article, there will be two devices involved:

  * a development machine, for instance a Linux or Mac laptop or desktop
    computer, from which we do most of the development.
  * a target board, for instance a Raspberry Pi 4, connected to the same
    network as the development machine, and to which we deploy the
    compiled binary. We assume that the target board is already
    configured to be reachable at a given IP address or hostname
    <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md> over the same network as the development machine, and has SSH exposed <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md>. We also assume that SSH is configured with public key based authentication <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server>, so that no password is required every time we connect to it.


  Installing Rust

First, we install Rust on the development machine, following the
instructions from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
<https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install> via the interactive |rustup|
installer.


  Hello World!

We first create the directory that will contain our Rust project. The
simplest way is to manually create an empty folder with the desired name
(e.g. |mkdir hello-world|), |cd| into it, and run |cargo init --bin|;
this creates all the necessary source files for an executable (binary)
hello world application.

We test that things are working fine by running |cargo run| from within
this folder, which *compiles and runs* the hello world application (for
now we are still doing everything on the development machine itself). If
everything is working, we see an |Hello, world!| message printed to the
terminal. So far so good!


  Hello Web!

To make things more interesting, we will build an HTTP server
application, which keeps running indefinitely in the background.

There are a few excellent alternatives
<https://levelup.gitconnected.com/actix-or-rocket-comparing-two-powerful-rust-web-frameworks-114a3540f0b3> when it comes to HTTP server frameworks in Rust. Rocket <https://rocket.rs/> is my personal favorite, but it requires a nightly version of the Rust compiler, so for this tutorial we will go with Actix <https://actix.rs/> to keep things simple.

First we add a *dependency* on the |actix-web| crate to the |Cargo.toml|
file:

[dependencies]
actix-web = "3.1.0"

Then we (mostly) copy the basic example from the Actix home page into
|./src/main.rs| (by replacing all its existing content), with some
modifications:

The main change we make is that instead of binding to |127.0.0.1:8080|,
which is a loopback address <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback> and
not actually exposed over any physical network interface, we instead
bind to |[::]:8080| , which is a shorthand notation for an IPv6
“unspecified” address
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#Unspecified_address>,
meaning the server will bind to all the available interfaces.

We also add a |println| instruction so that we can easily tell whether
and when the binary starts correctly, rather than having to stare at a
blank terminal and guess.

We run this again locally via |cargo run| and then open a browser tab to
|http://127.0.0.1:8080/| and we verify we can see a page being served
with the |Hello World!| message.


  Creating a deployment script

Since we will be iterating over our program, and each iteration involves
at a minimum compiling on the development machine and running on the
target board, it is useful to create a simple *script* with the
necessary commands, so that we can just run it and we don’t need to type
the commands out every time.

We create a text file in the same directory, called |deploy| , with the
following content (we will add more and more steps to it as we go):

The various |set -o| lines make bash behavior stricter in the event of
errors (see https://kvz.io/bash-best-practices.html
<https://kvz.io/bash-best-practices.html>) and log the commands before
executing them.

We then make the script executable with |chmod +x ./deploy| , so that we
can then just run it directly as |./deploy| , which we can try immediately.

At this point we have compiled our hello world in release mode (the
default is debug mode, which is faster to compile, but results in a less
optimized compiled binary). |cargo| writes out the compiled binary as
|./target/release/hello-world| .

We can *inspect* this compiled binary with the following command: |file
./target/release/hello-world| , which prints out something like

./target/release/hello-world: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=dfa8f424eff2133fc35a2a91d4a1f9546664f1bd, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, with debug_info, not stripped

Note that this is (at least on my machine) a 64-bit binary for the
*x86–64* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64>*architecture*. What
would happen if we just tried to copy and run it on the target Raspberry
Pi board? Let us add a line to our |deploy| script to try that!

The |TARGET_HOST| variable specifies the username and host name (or IP
address) of the target board, which must be reachable over the network
from the development machine.

The |SOURCE_PATH| variable specifies the path where the compiled binary
is produced *on the development machine* (relative to the current
directory), while |TARGET_PATH| determines where it will be copied *on
the target board* (we use an absolute path for this).

We use |rsync <https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync>| to efficiently copy
the binary to the target board over the network.

The last line connects to the target board over SSH and tries to run the
binary we just copied there. The |-t| flag to |ssh| ensures that the
command is terminated when we hit Ctrl-C in our terminal; without it,
the process may keep running in the background, which may become an
issue later on.

If we run this script, we get an *error* similar to the following:

bash: /home/pi/hello-world: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error

Which indeed confirms to us that we need to do put more effort into this
in order to end up with a binary that is compatible with the Raspberry Pi.

Let’s get back to work!


  Cross-compile time!

Now let us try to compile the same program, this time for the correct
target architecture.

First we need to install the appropriate Rust target platform
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html> for the
current Rust toolchain.

For a Raspberry Pi 4 (and also for most other recent Raspberry Pi
boards), we can use the |armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf| target.

Roughly, the target components have the following meaning:

  * |armv7| : the architecture to use for the target processor, in our
    case ARM v7 (even though Raspberry Pi 4 actually supports up to ARM
    v8
    <https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications/>)
  * |unknown| : the sub-architecture to use; in our case this just means
    the default option
    <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html#target-triple>
  * |linux| : the target Operating System
  * |gnueabihf| : the ABI to target; |gnu| means that it relies on the
    GNU C Library <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/> (also
    known as |libc|) for some functionality at runtime; |hf| means hard
    float, that is that the architecture supports hardware
    floating-point operations

The full command to run is:

rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf

We can now specify this new architecture via the |--target| flag of
|cargo|. We update our |deploy| script to reflect this:

Note that we also need to update the |SOURCE_PATH| variable to include
|TARGET_ARCH|, since |cargo
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/build-cache.html>|puts compiled
binaries for non-host architectures under subfolders named after the
specific compilation target
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/build-cache.html>.

When we run this version of the |deploy| script, at this point most
likely we get an error similar to following:

error: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1
  |
  = note: "cc" "-Wl,--as-needed" "-Wl,-z,noexecstack" "-L" [...]
  = note: /usr/bin/ld: /home/tzn/src/raspberry-pi-rs/target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/deps/hello_world-9195c885f830d71b.hello_world.c3yg8fqv-cgu.0.rcgu.o: relocations in generic ELF (EM: 40)

What is going wrong? The binary is actually getting compiled correctly
by |cargo|, but then *the final linking stage fails*, because |cargo| is
simply invoking |cc| and |ld| for this job, which on our development
machine only know how to deal with x86 binaries (or whatever
architecture the host has), and do not know anything about how to put
together ARM binaries. It looks like we need to persuade |cargo| to use
a more appropriate linker for this job. In fact, if this is the first
time we compile (or link) anything ARM-related, it is likely we do not
yet even have any tools installed that can do the job, so we first need
to procure them. On Ubuntu we can do this with the following command:

sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf

Now we should have the appropriate linker and compiler for ARM
installed. We can try invoking it with the |arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc|
command (which will just terminate immediately if invoked without any
arguments).

We still need to convince |cargo| to use it for the linking stage of our
binary though. In order to do this, we create a new file named
|./.cargo/config
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>| , in which we
enter the following:

[target.armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf]
linker = "arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc"

This instructs |cargo| to use the ARM-specific version of |gcc| for
linking binaries compiled for the |armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf| Rust
target.

One would think that we could have also used |arm-linux-gnueabihf-ld|
for this, which should work identically
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26152896/whats-the-difference-between-linking-by-gcc-and-ld>, but, for reference, if we do that we get the following error:

error: linking with `arm-linux-gnueabihf-ld` failed: exit code: 1
  |
  = note: "arm-linux-gnueabihf-ld" "-L" [...]
  = note: arm-linux-gnueabihf-ld: cannot find -lgcc_s

If we re-run the |deploy| script now, we finally see the |Hello World
server started| log line from our server, which means that the server is
finally correctly *running on the target board*!

We can open a browser tab and connect to the web server running there,
for instance |http://raspberrypi:8080| , and we should see the same web
page as before, this time being served by the Raspberry Pi itself! We
can also try connecting to it from another device (e.g. a smartphone
connected to the same network) to confirm.

When we press Ctrl-C from the terminal, the attached server is also
terminated (thanks to the |-t| flag passed to |ssh|), which lets us
re-run the script again later on, and the new server will work as expected.

If for whatever reason a previous instance of the server were still
running in the background, and we tried to start a new instance, we
would get an erro message similar to the following:

Error: Os { code: 98, kind: AddrInUse, message: "Address already in use" }

If this happens, the simplest way to fix it is to manually SSH to the
target board, and run something like |sudo killall hello-world| , which
kills any instance of processes called |hello-world| (hopefully nothing
else with that name is already running there). After this cleanup is
done, we can re-run |./deploy| and it should work again.


  Persistence

We now want to make this binary behave like a proper *service*, which
means *restarting* it if it crashes, and also automatically starting it
at *boot time*, without human intervention.

There are a few ways
<https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-run-a-raspberry-pi-program-on-startup> to run programs at startup on a Raspberry Pi. For this article we use |systemd <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd>|, which requires more configuration, but it is also much more solid and reliable than other alternatives.

We start by SSH’ing to the target board. From the terminal, we then
create a file called |/lib/systemd/system/hello-world.service| (we
probably need to run our text editor as root via |sudo|) on the target
board. The content of the newly created file may be something like:

We then save and exit the text editor, then run the following command to
make |systemd| *notice the new unit* (which we will have to repeat if we
make any changes to the unit file in the future):

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

We now *enable* the new unit with the following command:

sudo systemctl enable hello-world.service

This enables the unit but does not start it yet. In order to actually
*start* the service in the background, we run the following command:

sudo systemctl start hello-world.service

If everything goes well, we do not see any error message or other
output, but our server is running in the background. We can check this
by navigating to the URL from before, and also by running the following
command:

sudo systemctl status hello-world.service

which prints out something like

● hello-world.service - Hello World
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/hello-world.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2020-10-15 00:40:59 BST; 47s ago
 Main PID: 2310 (hello-world)
    Tasks: 6 (limit: 4915)
   CGroup: /system.slice/hello-world.service
           └─2310 /home/pi/hello-worldOct 15 20:54:18 raspberrypi systemd[1]: Started Hello World.
Oct 15 20:54:18 raspberrypi hello-world[2844]: Hello World server started

Confirming that the service is indeed active and running.

If necessary (especially for more complex applications) can check the
full *logs* for the service (even across restarts) with the following
command:

journalctl --unit=hello-world.service

Let us try to see what systemd does in order to keep the service up and
running, by simulating a crash via the |sudo killall hello-world|
command we saw earlier. If we do that, and then quickly (within the 10
second window we specified in the unit configuration) run |sudo
systemctl status hello-world.service| again, we see the following output:

● hello-world.service - Hello World
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/hello-world.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: activating (auto-restart) since Thu 2020-10-15 00:44:46 BST; 3s ago
  Process: 2347 ExecStart=/home/pi/hello-world (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
 Main PID: 2347 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)

Which tells us that the process is in the auto-restart phase, but has
not been restarted yet. If we try (quickly!) to navigate to the URL in
the browser, we indeed get a connection error. Predictably, if we wait a
few more seconds, systemd restarts the service, and the HTTP server is
up again.

We can now also try to manually restart the target board (e.g. by
unplugging it from power, and plugging it back in), and the server
should start again automatically after a few seconds / minutes, without
us having to do anything on the board itself.


  Updating server code

Let us try to make a change to the code and deploy a new version of the
server, in a way that works nicely with systemd.

For instance, we change the |Hello World| greeting to |Ciao Mondo| in
|./src/main.rs| . If we now run the current |./deploy| script again, we
get the following error:

Error: Os { code: 98, kind: AddrInUse, message: "Address already in use" }

This is because the previous version of the service (managed by systemd)
is still running in the background, and therefore we cannot run another
instance (even though it is now a different binary) binding to the same
port. What we actually want is to replace the previous binary, and ask
systemd nicely to restart the service for us. In order to do this, we
change the last line of our |deploy| script, so that we obtain the
following:

This script now compiles and copies the binary as before, but instead of
running it interactively as the final step, it just restarts the service
via the |systemctl restart| command, which stops the previous instance
and starts a new one, causing the *new version* of the binary to be
executed. We can check that the new version is indeed running by
navigating to the URL as we did before, and checking that the message
got updated.
